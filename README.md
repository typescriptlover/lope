    storage: "redis",
    storageOptions: {
        url: "your redis uri"
        // url is optional,
        // otherwise it will use default redis connection if not set.
    }
    logging: "default",
    // "all" | "default"
    // all will show you retrieval, uploading, failure logs, and anything extra.
    // default will show you important logs only.
})

export default lope;
```
