**why**

_sometimes you just want a small handy image storage without a hassle to set up,
especially for personal projects or development environments_

> also, this is mostly for my personal use

**pkgs**

- `node redis` as redis client
- `pika` for generating file ids
- `chalk` for pretty logs

**to do**

- file format validation
- max file size validation
- proper error handling
- documenting in readme
